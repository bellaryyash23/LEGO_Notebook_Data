# Analysing a Dataset of LEGO Pieces in Pandas & Matplotlib of Python

🌟We're going to be diving deep into a dataset all about LEGO, which will help us answer a whole bunch of interesting questions about the history of the company, their product offering, and which LEGO set rules them all:

❓What is the most enormous LEGO set ever created and how many parts did it have?

❓In which year were the first LEGO sets released and how many sets did the company sell when it first launched?

❓Which LEGO theme has the most sets? Is it Harry Potter, Ninjago, Friends or something else?

❓When did the LEGO company really take-off based on its product offering? How many themes and sets did it release every year?

❓Did LEGO sets grow in size and complexity over time? Do older LEGO sets tend to have more or fewer parts than newer sets?

🌟To Find Answer to all these questions, the methods of Pandas & Matplotlib of Python used are:

✅Combine the groupby() and count() functions to aggregate data & use the .value_counts() function

✅Slice DataFrames using the square bracket notation e.g., df[:-2] or df[:10]

✅Use the .agg() function to run an operation on a particular column

✅rename() columns of DataFrames

✅Create a line chart with two separate axes to visualise data that have different scales & reate a scatter plot in Matplotlib

✅Work with tables in a relational database by using primary and foreign keys & use .merge() DataFrames along a particular column.
